| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Apache TVM](https://github.com/apache/tvm) | _a compiler stack for deep learning systems. It is designed to close the gap between the productivity-focused deep learning frameworks, and the performance- and efficiency-focused hardware backends_ |
| [XLA](https://github.com/openxla/xla) | _takes models from popular ML frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX, and optimizes them for high-performance execution across different hardware platforms including GPUs, CPUs, and ML accelerators_ |
