#### Model Compilers & Optimizers

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Apache TVM](https://github.com/apache/tvm) | _a compiler stack for deep learning systems. It is designed to close the gap between the productivity-focused deep learning frameworks, and the performance- and efficiency-focused hardware backends_ |
| [Speedster](https://github.com/nebuly-ai/nebullvm/tree/main/apps/accelerate/speedster) | _automatically applies the best set of SOTA optimization techniques to achieve the maximum inference speed-up (latency, throughput, model size) physically possible on your hardware (single machine)_ |
| [XLA](https://github.com/openxla/xla) | _takes models from popular ML frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX, and optimizes them for high-performance execution across different hardware platforms including GPUs, CPUs, and ML accelerators_ |
